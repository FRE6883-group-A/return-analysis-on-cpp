Earnings-Based Stock Classification and Event-Driven Return Analysis on C++

FRE6883 Financial Computing C++ Project.
A C++ financial computing framework to evaluate the impact of quarterly earnings announcements on stock price movements across Russell 3000 equities. The project involved: (1) Retrieving and parsing historical stock price data via HTTP APIs using libcurl. (2) Designing C++ classes to manage stock-level data and earnings metadata. (3) Implementing financial computations for AAR, CAAR, and their standard deviations across three performance-based stock groups. (4) Leveraging STL containers (maps, vectors) and object-oriented programming principles (inheritance, encapsulation). (5) Visualizing comparative cumulative abnormal returns (CAAR) using gnuplot.
