Earnings-Based Stock Classification and Event-Driven Return Analysis on C++

FRE6883 Financial Computing C++ Project.
A C++ financial computing framework to evaluate the impact of quarterly earnings announcements on stock price movements across Russell 3000 equities. The project involved: 
* Retrieving and parsing historical stock price data via HTTP APIs using libcurl.
* Designing C++ classes to manage stock-level data and earnings metadata.
* Implementing financial computations for AAR, CAAR, and their standard deviations across three performance-based stock groups.
* Leveraging STL containers (maps, vectors) and object-oriented programming principles (inheritance, encapsulation).
* Visualizing comparative cumulative abnormal returns (CAAR) using gnuplot.
